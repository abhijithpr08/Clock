## How This Project Works

JavaScript:

- The `setInterval()` function updates the clock every second.
- The `Date()` object gets the current hour, minute, and second.
- Clock hand positions are calculated using ratios and angles.
- The digital display shows formatted time with AM/PM.

CSS:

- The clock design uses circles and hand shapes.
- Hands rotate using CSS variables.
- Media queries resize everything for mobile screens.

HTML:

- Clock layout is structured using `div` elements.
- Numbers from 1 to 12 are placed around the clock face.
- A digital time container is placed beside the analog clock.
